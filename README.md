# Skin lession classification mobile and web app

The aim of this project was to create universal app that would help users to examine their skin lessions.

## About

The project is written to be multi-platform, so basically, it is one code that is then translated to be deployable to the web, Android, and iOS. It allows users to take or select photos that are further classified as either benign or malignant skin changes. As it is rather proof of concept, the model used for classification is simple and during phase test yields results about 60-70% when it comes to accuracy. Models that have an accuracy of about 98% were also created, but managing them in memory (especially for mobile devices) was extremely slow. Therefore worse but lighter model was picked to present the concept of this project.
